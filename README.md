Q1:  
    a. When I need to catch only one element with a specific ID i will use getElementById;
    b. When I will call more than one element with similar class name I will use getElementByClassName
    c. querySelector gives the first element of many elements under a single class
    d. querySelectorAll gives all the elements under a single class name

Q2:
    createElement() is used to create new element and to insert something in that element appendChild() is uded in DOM

Q3: 
    If I want to go to a target element I can use event bubble concept in JS, it can go step by step to the target from parent. So I can also reach to the parent from a target by bubbling

Q4:
    I don't have clear concept on this quesiton.

Q5:
    I don't know what does preventDefault() do. But stopPropagation stops event bubbling.
